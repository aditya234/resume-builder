                "Progenet, our submission for our undergrad Major Project, is our take on creating a planetary scale procedurally rendered spherical terrain with real-time realistic atmospheric scattering. The planet itself is therefore a function of few parameters that define how it is generated in real-time in the GPU.",
                "The planet is generated from a base Icosahedron geometry that provides equispaced vertices that later reduces artifacts while height generation. To generate the elevation for each vertices on the planet we use 3D Simplex Noise, which is a coherent random function returning a normalized height value. This value can be later scaled to the required height. To make the terrains interesting, multiple octaves of the noise function are used with increasing frequency and decreasing amplitude.",
                "Since the planet is to be observed from space as well as from ground-level, we use Continuous Level of Detail to dynamically subdivide the base geometry to generate more detail as required. Since CDLOD generates a too large a number of vertices to be pushed to the GPU, we implement Backface and Frustum culling to discard vertices not in view.",
